# CreditCardFraudDetection
The "Credit Card Fraud Detection" project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset has the following characteristics:
* Number of transactions: 284,807
* Number of frauds: 492 (0.172% of all transactions)
* Features: 30 (28 anonymized features, 'Time', and 'Amount')
## Installation

```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the required packages:
